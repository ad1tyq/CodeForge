## Team Simpsons - CodeForge
### About the team

We are team Simpsons and this is our prototype for round 1 of the HackForge hackathon under the theme Education & Skill Development: Gamified Coding Practice Platform.

### About the project

CodeForge is an interactive, gamified platform designed to be the ultimate training ground for aspiring developers. The system replaces traditional, passive learning with hands-on coding challenges, real-time feedback, and competitive leaderboards, providing a critical layer of engagement to prevent the loss of motivation that derails most new coders.
